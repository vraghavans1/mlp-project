# MLP Project T22025

This repository contains code for the Kaggle competition
"Engage-2 Value from Clicks to Conversions". The goal is to
predict customer purchase value from multi-session behavioural data.

A file named `submission.csv` will be produced with the required
`id` and `purchaseValue` columns for submission.

## Configuration
